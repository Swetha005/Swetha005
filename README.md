# Hi there, I'm Swetha 👋  
Welcome to my GitHub space!

I'm a passionate **Machine Learning enthusiast** who loves building smart and creative solutions using code. I enjoy exploring how technology can solve real-world problems, and I'm currently diving deep into **AI/ML**, **NLP**, and **UI/UX design**.

## 🚀 Projects I've Worked On
- 🔍 **Lifespan Predictor**  
  Predicts human lifespan based on lifestyle habits like sleep, activity, and diet using ML models.

- 🕵️‍♂️ **Lie Detector**  
  A machine learning-based system that analyzes patterns in speech/text to detect deception.

## 🌱 Currently Learning & Exploring
- 🧠 Deep Learning with Python  
- 💬 Natural Language Processing (NLP) 
- 📚 RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) pipelines  
- 🤗 Hugging Face Transformers & Datasets  
- 🎨 UI/UX Design Principles (Figma, Design Thinking)

## 💡 Interests
- AI for good  
- Human-centered design
